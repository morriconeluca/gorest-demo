This is a simple demo web app to show how to use [Gorest API](https://gorest.co.in/). It is build with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

You can visit the [demo](https://gorest-demo.vercel.app/) to see how it works.

## Getting Started

First, add your .env file:

```bash
cp env.example.txt .env
```

Replace the placeholders in this file with your own values.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter).
